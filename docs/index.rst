   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to gettext.js's documentation!
======================================

gettext.js is a tool consisting of two parts: A compiler that compiles .mo
files into Javascript (either a Javascript file that can be included on your
page or a JSON file which can be loaded asynchronously) written in Python 3.5
and a Javascript runtime which exposes a GNU gettext like API to use those mo
files in your browser.

You don't need to use Python in your project, the only thing you need at
runtime is Javascript.
